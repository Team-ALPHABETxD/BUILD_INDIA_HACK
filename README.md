# BUILD_INDIA_HACK

## Introduction

This is a project containing Jupyter Notebooks (e.g. `Initial.ipynb`, `Optimisation.ipynb`) that implement your model and experiments. This README describes how to set up the environment, run the code, reproduce results, and interpret outputs.

## Table of Contents

* [Introduction](#introduction)
* [Prerequisites / Dependencies](#prerequisites--dependencies)
* [Installation / Setup](#installation--setup)
* [Usage: Running the Model & Testing](#usage-running-the-model)
* [Reproducing Final Results](#reproducing-final-results)
* [Expected Outputs & Interpretation](#expected-outputs--interpretation)
* [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Prerequisites / Dependencies

Before running the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python (version 3.x — recommended 3.8 or newer)
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* Common scientific / data-science packages (depending on notebook content), e.g.:

  * `numpy`
  * `pandas`
  * `scikit-learn` (or any ML library you're using)
  * `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (for plotting, if needed)
  * Any other libraries imported in the notebooks (you’ll see `import` statements at the top)

If there is a `requirements.txt` (not present currently), you can install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

> ⚠️ As of now, the repository contains only two `.ipynb` files and **no explicit dependency manifest**. It's best to inspect the notebooks and manually install any required packages.

## Installation / Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Team-ALPHABETxD/BUILD_INDIA_HACK.git
   cd BUILD_INDIA_HACK
   ```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required packages manually (per the notebooks), e.g.:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

5. Open and run the notebook(s), e.g. `Initial.ipynb`.

## Usage: Running the Model & Testing

* Open `Initial.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells (e.g. “Run → Run All”).
* Inspect intermediate outputs such as data processing, training steps, evaluation metrics, visualizations etc.
* To try different parameters or datasets (if supported), modify relevant cells and re-run.
* To test performance or behavior under new inputs (if applicable), you can add new cells or functions to load custom inputs and run model inference.

If you add more code (e.g. new scripts, helper modules), it's recommended to convert notebooks into `.py` scripts or modularize code for clarity and reproducibility.

## Reproducing Final Results

To reproduce the final results (as you obtained when originally running the notebooks):

1. Use the same data (if external input/data files are needed) and keep the same random seed (if any seed is set in the notebooks).
2. Run the notebooks from top → bottom without modification.
3. Use the same versions of all dependencies (or very close) — differences in library versions may cause differences in results (especially in ML contexts).
4. If there is any data-splitting, shuffling, or randomness involved (e.g. train/test split, random initialization), ensure that the random seed (if set) remains the same to get identical outputs.

If you want to automate this, consider exporting the notebooks (e.g. using `nbconvert`) or writing a wrapper script that runs all steps in a clean, reproducible environment.

## Expected Outputs & How to Interpret Them

Depending on the content of the notebooks, expected outputs may include:

* Processed data tables / summaries (e.g. data cleaning, transformations)
* Trained model object(s) or metrics (e.g. accuracy, loss, evaluation scores)
* Plots / visualizations (e.g. performance curves, feature importance, comparison graphs)
* Any predictions or inferences generated by the model

**Interpretation guidelines:**

* For numeric metrics: lower/higher values may indicate better/worse model performance (depending on metric).
* For visualizations: examine trends, outliers, and any relevant patterns.
* If outputs include predictions or classifications: cross-check with ground truth (if available) or validation data to assess correctness.
* Document any assumptions, data preprocessing steps, or hyperparameters used — this helps understand model behavior and replicate results.

## Troubleshooting

* **Missing dependencies / import errors:** Check the `import` lines in notebooks; install the missing package using `pip` (or `conda`) before re-running.
* **Version-related issues:** If outputs differ unexpectedly (especially in ML models), try to use the same library versions as originally used.
* **Notebook output truncated / plot not showing:** Ensure that you run cells in correct order (or “Restart & Run All”), and that your environment supports plotting (for Jupyter).
* **Data or file paths not found:** If notebooks expect external data/files, ensure they are present in appropriate directories or update paths accordingly.
